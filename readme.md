## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

1. Install Docker Desktop and WSL2
2. Clone repo https://github.com/ObelusFamily/Anythink-Market-ic53d.git
3. Run docker-compose up in the dir
